XboxMouse
=========

This is an application to control your desktop with the xbox360 gamepad. 
All applications out there are working but are lacking in comfort. 

Planed features: 
-Full configurable button mappings via profile / configuration file
-Application specifiec settings ( configured via profile ) 
-Overlays for volume ( like on android or e.g. KDE )
  -Maybe more than just volume ... we'll see.
